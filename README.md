### How to use webpack aliases to import modules

When we have a deep folder structure, the module import declaration become too confusing

```js
import React from 'react'
import Button from '../../../components/button'
//...
```

With webpack aliases ([See more](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvealias))

```js
import React from 'react'
import Button from '@components/button'
//...
```

> The aliases is pre-configured in this project, if you need more paths or change alias name, they are configured in `config/webpack.config.js` inside `alias` definition.

## Components

React components are usefull to improve code reusability.
To create a component create a folder with component name, e.g. button, and inside create two files index.js, component.test.js and styles.scss (if applies).

```
├── components
    ├── button
        ├── index.js
        ├── button.test.js
        ├── styles.scss
```

## Pages

Are the pages (or screens) of application, e.g. login and home, the structure are the same of components.

```
├── pages
    ├── login
        ├── index.js
        ├── styles.scss
    ├── home
        ├── index.js
        ├── styles.scss
```

## Tests

React use Jest as test runner, and is recommended use react-test-library

To make DOM assertions jest use [jest-dom](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom)

## Custom scripts

### Coverage report

```shell
yarn serve:coverage
```

Create a simple NodeJS HTTP server to serve static page generated by jest coverage tests
